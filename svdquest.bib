%   abstract = {MOTIVATION: Species tree estimation in the presence of incomplete
% 	lineage sorting (ILS) is a major challenge for phylogenomic analysis.
% 	Although many methods have been developed for this problem, little
% 	is understood about the relative performance of these methods when
% 	estimated gene trees are poorly estimated, owing to inadequate phylogenetic
% 	signal. RESULTS: We explored the performance of some methods for
% 	estimating species trees from multiple markers on simulated datasets
% 	in which gene trees differed from the species tree owing to ILS.
% 	We included *BEAST, concatenated analysis and several 'summary methods':
% 	BUCKy, MP-EST, minimize deep coalescence, matrix representation with
% 	parsimony and the greedy consensus. We found that *BEAST and concatenation
% 	gave excellent results, often with substantially improved accuracy
% 	over the other methods. We observed that *BEAST's accuracy is largely
% 	due to its ability to co-estimate the gene trees and species tree.
% 	However, *BEAST is computationally intensive, making it challenging
% 	to run on datasets with 100 or more genes or with more than 20 taxa.
% 	We propose a new approach to species tree estimation in which the
% 	genes are partitioned into sets, and the species tree is estimated
% 	from the resultant 'supergenes'. We show that this technique improves
% 	the scalability of *BEAST without affecting its accuracy and improves
% 	the accuracy of the summary methods. Thus, naive binning can improve
% 	phylogenomic analysis in the presence of ILS. CONTACT: tandy@cs.utexas.edu

  abstract = {Deuterostomes comprise vertebrates, the related invertebrate chordates
	(tunicates and cephalochordates) and three other invertebrate taxa:
	hemichordates, echinoderms and Xenoturbella. The relationships between
	invertebrate and vertebrate deuterostomes are clearly important for
	understanding our own distant origins. Recent phylogenetic studies
	of chordate classes and a sea urchin have indicated that urochordates
	might be the closest invertebrate sister group of vertebrates, rather
	than cephalochordates, as traditionally believed. More remarkable
	is the suggestion that cephalochordates are closer to echinoderms
	than to vertebrates and urochordates, meaning that chordates are
	paraphyletic. To study the relationships among all deuterostome groups,
	we have assembled an alignment of more than 35,000 homologous amino
	acids, including new data from a hemichordate, starfish and Xenoturbella.
	We have also sequenced the mitochondrial genome of Xenoturbella.
	We support the clades Olfactores (urochordates and vertebrates) and
	Ambulacraria (hemichordates and echinoderms). Analyses using our
	new data, however, do not support a cephalochordate and echinoderm
	grouping and we conclude that chordates are monophyletic. Finally,
	nuclear and mitochondrial data place Xenoturbella as the sister group
	of the two ambulacrarian phyla. As such, Xenoturbella is shown to
	be an independent phylum, Xenoturbellida, bringing the number of
	living deuterostome phyla to four.},

	the modified mincut supertree algorithm to construct an estimated
	species tree from inferred rooted triples of concatenated alignments.
	We term this method SuperMatrix Rooted Triple (SMRT) and use the
	notation SMRT-ML when rooted triples are inferred by ML. We use simulations
	to investigate the performance of SMRT-ML under Jukes-Cantor and
	general time-reversible substitution models for four- and five-taxon
	species trees and also apply the method to an empirical data set
	of yeast genes. We find that SMRT-ML converges to the correct species
	tree in many cases in which ML on the full concatenated data set
	fails to do so. SMRT-ML can be conservative in that its output tree
	is often partially unresolved for problematic clades. We show analytically
	that when the species tree is clocklike and mutations occur under
	the Cavender-Farris-Neyman substitution model, as the number of genes
	increases, SMRT-ML is increasingly likely to infer the correct species
	tree even when the most likely gene tree does not match the species

	similarities and an apparently increased complexity in cephalochordates

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurately modeling the sequence substitution process
	is required for the correct estimation of evolutionary parameters,
	be they phylogenetic relationships, substitution rates or ancestral
	states; it is also crucial to simulate realistic data sets. Such
	simulation procedures are needed to estimate the null-distribution
	of complex statistics, an approach referred to as parametric bootstrapping,
	and are also used to test the quality of phylogenetic reconstruction
	programs. It has often been observed that homologous sequences can
	vary widely in their nucleotide or amino-acid compositions, revealing
	that sequence evolution has changed importantly among lineages, and
	may therefore be most appropriately approached through non-homogeneous
	models. Several programs implementing such models have been developed,
	but they are limited in their possibilities: only a few particular
	models are available for likelihood optimization, and data sets cannot
	be easily generated using the resulting estimated parameters. RESULTS:
	We hereby present a general implementation of non-homogeneous models
	of substitutions. It is available as dedicated classes in the Bio++
	libraries and can hence be used in any C++ program. Two programs
	that use these classes are also presented. The first one, Bio++ Maximum
	Likelihood (BppML), estimates parameters of any non-homogeneous model
	and the second one, Bio++ Sequence Generator (BppSeqGen), simulates
	the evolution of sequences from these models. These programs allow
	the user to describe non-homogeneous models through a property file
	with a simple yet powerful syntax, without any programming required.
	CONCLUSION: We show that the general implementation introduced here
	can accommodate virtually any type of non-homogeneous models of sequence
	evolution, including heterotachous ones, while being computer efficient.
	We furthermore illustrate the use of such general models for parametric
	bootstrapping, using tests of non-homogeneity applied to an already
	published ribosomal RNA data set.},

	variation expected for gene trees from multiple unlinked loci sampled
	from a single species history after a coalescent process. Application
	of the model to a 106-gene data set from yeast shows that the set
	of gene trees recovered by statistically acknowledging the shared

	reduced compared with treating the history of each locus independently

	we show that, with large numbers of loci, highly resolved species
	trees can be estimated under conditions in which concatenation of

	tree/species tree congruence is high, species trees can be resolved

	Each of these is analyzed, and the variation among the resulting

	of ray-finned fishes, the lack of a single comprehensive phylogeny

	of traditional phylogenies based on morphology. With the advent of
	molecular data, this problem has been replaced by another one, statistical
	inconsistency, which stems from an erroneous interpretation of convergences
	induced by multiple changes. The analysis of alignments rich in both
	genes and species, combined with a probabilistic method (maximum
	likelihood or Bayesian) using sophisticated models of sequence evolution,
	should alleviate these two major limitations. We applied this approach
	to a dataset of 94 genes and 79 species using CAT, a previously developed

	The resulting tree is in good agreement with current knowledge: the
	monophyly of most major groups (e.g. Chordata, Arthropoda, Lophotrochozoa,
	Ecdysozoa, Protostomia) was recovered with high support. Two results
	are surprising and are discussed in an evo-devo framework: the sister-group
	relationship of Platyhelminthes and Annelida to the exclusion of
	Mollusca, contradicting the Neotrochozoa hypothesis, and, with a
	lower statistical support, the paraphyly of Deuterostomia. These
	results, in particular the status of deuterostomes, need further
	confirmation, both through increased taxonomic sampling, and future
	improvements of probabilistic models.},

%   abstract = {The estimation of species trees (phylogenies) is one of the most important
% 	problems in evolutionary biology, and recently, there has been greater
% 	appreciation of the need to estimate species trees directly rather
% 	than using gene trees as a surrogate. A Bayesian method constructed
% 	under the multispecies coalescent model can consistently estimate
% 	species trees but involves intensive computation, which can hinder
% 	its application to the phylogenetic analysis of large-scale genomic
% 	data. Many summary statistics-based approaches, such as shallowest
% 	coalescences (SC) and Global LAteSt Split (GLASS), have been developed
% 	to infer species phylogenies for multilocus data sets. In this paper,
% 	we propose 2 methods, species tree estimation using average ranks
% 	of coalescences (STAR) and species tree estimation using average
% 	coalescence times (STEAC), based on the summary statistics of coalescence
% 	times. It can be shown that the 2 methods are statistically consistent
% 	under the multispecies coalescent model. STAR uses the ranks of coalescences
% 	and is thus resistant to variable substitution rates along the branches
% 	in gene trees. A simulation study suggests that STAR consistently
% 	outperforms STEAC, SC, and GLASS when the substitution rates among
% 	lineages are highly variable. Two real genomic data sets were analyzed
% 	by the 2 methods and produced species trees that are consistent with
% 	previous results.},

%   abstract = {Exploration of the relationship between gene trees and their containing
% 	species trees leads to consideration of how to reconstruct species
% 	trees from gene trees and of the concept of phylogeny as a cloud
% 	of gene histories. When gene copies are sampled from various species,
% 	the gene tree relating these copies might disagree with the species
% 	phylogeny. This discord can arise from horizontal transfer (including
% 	hybridization), lineage sorting, and gene duplication and extinction.
% 	Lineage sorting could also be called deep coalescence, the failure
% 	of ancestral copies to coalesce (looking backwards in time) into
% 	a common ancestral copy until deeper than previous speciation events.
% 	These events depend on various factors; for instance, deep coalescence
% 	is more likely if the branches of the species tree are short (in
% 	generations) and wide (in population size). A similar dependence
% 	on process is found in historical biogeography and host-parasite
% 	relationships. Each of the processes of discord could yield a different
% 	parsimony criterion for reconstructing the species tree from a set
% 	of gene trees: with horizontal transfer, choose the species tree
% 	that minimizes the number of transfer events; with deep coalescence,
% 	choose the tree minimizing the number of extra gene lineages that
% 	had to coexist along species lineages; with gene duplication, choose
% 	the tree minimizing duplication and/or extinction events. Maximum
% 	likelihood methods for reconstructing the species tree are also possible
% 	because coalescence theory provides the probability that a particular
% 	gene tree would occur given a species tree (with branch lengths and
% 	widths specified). In considering these issues, one is provoked to
% 	reconsider precisely what is phylogeny. Perhaps it is misleading
% 	to view some gene trees as agreeing and other gene trees as disagreeing
% 	with the species tree; rather, all of the gene trees are part of
% 	the species tree, which can be visualized like a fuzzy statistical
% 	distribution, a cloud of gene histories. Alternatively, phylogeny
% 	might be (and has been) viewed not as a history of what happened,
% 	genetically, but as a history of what could have happened, i.e.,
% 	a history of changes in the probabilities of inter-breeding.},

%   abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Supertree methods combine trees on subsets of
% 	the full taxon set together to produce a tree on the entire set of
% 	taxa. Of the many supertree methods, the most popular is MRP (Matrix
% 	Representation with Parsimony), a method that operates by first encoding
% 	the input set of source trees by a large matrix (the "MRP matrix")
% 	over \{0,1,?\}, and then running maximum parsimony heuristics on
% 	the MRP matrix. Experimental studies evaluating MRP in comparison
% 	to other supertree methods have established that for large datasets,
% 	MRP generally produces trees of equal or greater accuracy than other
% 	methods, and can run on larger datasets. A recent development in
% 	supertree methods is SuperFine+MRP, a method that combines MRP with
% 	a divide-and-conquer approach, and produces more accurate trees in
% 	less time than MRP. In this paper we consider a new approach for
% 	supertree estimation, called MRL (Matrix Representation with Likelihood).
% 	MRL begins with the same MRP matrix, but then analyzes the MRP matrix
% 	using heuristics (such as RAxML) for 2-state Maximum Likelihood.
% 	RESULTS: We compared MRP and SuperFine+MRP with MRL and SuperFine+MRL
% 	on simulated and biological datasets. We examined the MRP and MRL
% 	scores of each method on a wide range of datasets, as well as the
% 	resulting topological accuracy of the trees. Our experimental results
% 	show that MRL, coupled with a very good ML heuristic such as RAxML,
% 	produced more accurate trees than MRP, and MRL scores were more strongly
% 	correlated with topological accuracy than MRP scores. CONCLUSIONS:
% 	SuperFine+MRP when based upon a good MRP heuristic such as TNT, produces
% 	among the best scores for both MRP and MRL, and is generally faster
% 	and more topologically accurate than other supertree methods we tested.},

	are important parameters in models of population genetics and human

	sizes, based on counting mismatches between the species tree and
	the inferred gene trees, is highly biased as it ignores uncertainties
	in gene tree reconstruction. In this article, we develop a Bayes
	method for simultaneous estimation of the species divergence times
	and current and ancestral population sizes. The method uses DNA sequence
	data from multiple loci and extracts information about conflicts
	among gene tree topologies and coalescent times to estimate ancestral
	population sizes. The topology of the species tree is assumed known.
	A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is implemented to integrate
	over uncertain gene trees and branch lengths (or coalescence times)
	at each locus as well as species divergence times. The method can
	handle any species tree and allows different numbers of sequences
	at different loci. We apply the method to published noncoding DNA
	sequences from the human and the great apes. There are strong correlations
	between posterior estimates of speciation times and ancestral population
	sizes. With the use of an informative prior for the human-chimpanzee
	divergence date, the population size of the common ancestor of the
	two species is estimated to be approximately 20,000, with a 95\%
	credibility interval (8000, 40,000). Our estimates, however, are
	affected by model assumptions as well as data quality. We suggest
	that reliable estimates have yet to await more data and more realistic

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tunicates represent a key metazoan group as the sister-group
	of vertebrates within chordates. The six complete mitochondrial genomes
	available so far for tunicates have revealed distinctive features.
	Extensive gene rearrangements and particularly high evolutionary
	rates have been evidenced with regard to other chordates. This peculiar
	evolutionary dynamics has hampered the reconstruction of tunicate
	phylogenetic relationships within chordates based on mitogenomic
	data. RESULTS: In order to further understand the atypical evolutionary
	dynamics of the mitochondrial genome of tunicates, we determined
	the complete sequence of the solitary ascidian Herdmania momus. This
	genome from a stolidobranch ascidian presents the typical tunicate
	gene content with 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs and 24 tRNAs which
	are all encoded on the same strand. However, it also presents a novel
	gene arrangement, highlighting the extreme plasticity of gene order
	observed in tunicate mitochondrial genomes. Probabilistic phylogenetic
	inferences were conducted on the concatenation of the 13 mitochondrial
	protein-coding genes from representatives of major metazoan phyla.
	We show that whereas standard homogeneous amino acid models support
	an artefactual sister position of tunicates relative to all other
	bilaterians, the CAT and CAT+BP site- and time-heterogeneous mixture
	models place tunicates as the sister-group of vertebrates within
	monophyletic chordates. Moreover, the reference phylogeny indicates
	that tunicate mitochondrial genomes have experienced a drastic acceleration
	in their evolutionary rate that equally affects protein-coding and
	ribosomal-RNA genes. CONCLUSION: This is the first mitogenomic study
	supporting the new chordate phylogeny revealed by recent phylogenomic
	analyses. It illustrates the beneficial effects of an increased taxon
	sampling coupled with the use of more realistic amino acid substitution
	models for the reconstruction of animal phylogeny.},

	for the body plan of the last common ancestor of animals and the
	paleoecology of the late Precambrian. We have sequenced seven nuclear
	housekeeping genes from 17 new sponges, bringing the total to 29
	species analyzed, including multiple representatives of the Demospongiae,
	Calcarea, Hexactinellida, and Homoscleromorpha, and analyzed a data

	on the support of the nodes in our trees, and we identified clades
	most likely to represent phylogenetic artifacts through the comparison
	of trees derived using different methods (and models) and through
	site-stripping analyses. Further, we investigated compositional heterogeneity
	and tested whether amino acid composition bias affected our results.
	Finally, we used Bayes factors to compare our results against previously
	published phylogenies. All our maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian
	analyses find sponges to be paraphyletic, with all analyses finding
	three extant paraphyletic sponge lineages, Demospongiae plus Hexactinellida,
	Calcarea, and Homoscleromorpha. All but one of our ML and Bayesian
	analyses support the monophyly of Eumetazoa (here Cnidaria + Bilateria)
	and a sister group relationship between Placozoa (here Trichoplax
	adhaerens) and Eumetazoa. Bayes factors invariably provide decisive
	support in favor of poriferan paraphyly when compared against either
	a sister group relationship between Porifera and Cnidaria or with
	a monophyletic Porifera with respect to a monophyletic Eumetazoa.
	Although we were able to recover sponge monophyly using our data
	set, this was only possible under unrealistic evolutionary models,
	if poorly performing phylogenetic methods were used, or in situations
	where the potential for the generation of tree reconstruction artifacts
	was artificially exacerbated. Everything considered, our data set

	be shown that two seemingly dissimilar types of eubacteria Deinococcus
	and the ubiquitous hot spring organism Thermus are distantly but
	specifically related to one another. This confirms an earlier report
	based upon 16S rRNA oligonucleotide cataloging studies (Hensel et
	al., 1986). Their two lineages form a distinctive grouping within
	the eubacteria that deserved the taxonomic status of a phylum. The
	(partial) sequence of T. aquaticus rRNA appears relatively close
	to those of other thermophilic eubacteria. e.g. Thermotoga maritima
	and Thermomicrobium roseum. However, this closeness does not reflect
	a true evolutionary closeness; rather it is due to a "thermophilic
	convergence", the result of unusually high G+C composition in the
	rRNAs of thermophilic bacteria. Unless such compositional biases
	are taken into account, the branching order and root of phylogenetic
	trees can be incorrectly inferred.},

  abstract = {Four New World genera of dwarf boas (Exiliboa, Trachyboa, Tropidophis,
	and Ungaliophis) have been placed by many systematists in a single
	group (traditionally called Tropidophiidae). However, the monophyly
	of this group has been questioned in several studies. Moreover, the
	overall relationships among basal snake lineages, including the placement
	of the dwarf boas, are poorly understood. We obtained mtDNA sequence
	data for 12S, 16S, and intervening tRNA-val genes from 23 species
	of snakes representing most major snake lineages, including all four
	genera of New World dwarf boas. We then examined the phylogenetic
	position of these species by estimating the phylogeny of the basal
	snakes. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that New World dwarf boas
	are not monophyletic. Instead, we find Exiliboa and Ungaliophis to
	be most closely related to sand boas (Erycinae), boas (Boinae), and
	advanced snakes (Caenophidea), whereas Tropidophis and Trachyboa
	form an independent clade that separated relatively early in snake
	radiation. Our estimate of snake phylogeny differs significantly
	in other ways from some previous estimates of snake phylogeny. For
	instance, pythons do not cluster with boas and sand boas, but instead
	show a strong relationship with Loxocemus and Xenopeltis. Additionally,
	uropeltids cluster strongly with Cylindrophis, and together are embedded
	in what has previously been considered the macrostomatan radiation.
	These relationships are supported by both bootstrapping (parametric
	and nonparametric approaches) and Bayesian analysis, although Bayesian
	support values are consistently higher than those obtained from nonparametric
	bootstrapping. Simulations show that Bayesian support values represent
	much better estimates of phylogenetic accuracy than do nonparametric
	bootstrap support values, at least under the conditions of our study.},

	of gene trees, when gene tree incongruence is assumed to be due to
	incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), is Minimize Deep Coalescence (MDC).
	Exact algorithms for inferring the species tree from rooted, binary
	trees under MDC were recently introduced. Nevertheless, in phylogenetic
	analyses of biological data sets, estimated gene trees may differ
	from true gene trees, be incompletely resolved, and not necessarily
	rooted. In this article, we propose new MDC formulations for the
	cases where the gene trees are unrooted/binary, rooted/non-binary,
	and unrooted/non-binary. Further, we prove structural theorems that
	allow us to extend the algorithms for the rooted/binary gene tree
	case to these cases in a straightforward manner. In addition, we
	devise MDC-based algorithms for cases when multiple alleles per species
	may be sampled. We study the performance of these methods in coalescent-based
	computer simulations.},

abstract ={PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Estimating phylogenetic relationships in relatively recent evolutionary radiations is challenging, especially if short branches associated with recent divergence result in multiple gene tree histories. We combine anchored enrichment next-generation sequencing with species tree analyses to produce a robust estimate of phylogenetic relationships in the genus Protea (Proteaceae), an iconic radiation in South Africa.METHODS: We sampled multiple individuals within 59 out of 112 species of Protea and 6 outgroup species for a total of 163 individuals, and obtained sequences for 498 low-copy, orthologous nuclear loci using anchored phylogenomics. We compare several approaches for building species trees, and explore gene tree–species tree discrepancies to determine whether poor phylogenetic resolution reflects a lack of informative sites, incomplete lineage sorting, or hybridization.KEY RESULTS: Phylogenetic estimates from species tree approaches are similar to one another and recover previously well-supported clades within Protea, in addition to providing well-supported phylogenetic hypotheses for previously poorly resolved intrageneric relationships. Individual gene trees are markedly different from one another and from species trees. Nonetheless, analyses indicate that differences among gene trees occur primarily concerning clades supported by short branches.CONCLUSIONS: Species tree methods using hundreds of nuclear loci provided strong support for many previously unresolved relationships in the radiation of the genus Protea. In cases where support for particular relationships remains low, these appear to arise from few informative sites and lack of information rather than strongly supported disagreement among gene trees.},
