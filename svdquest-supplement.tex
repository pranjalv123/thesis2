\subsection{Cases where SVDquartets failed to return any quartet trees}
\label{svdquartets-failure}
On several model conditions, SVDquartets+PAUP* and SVDquest failed to return a tree; a review of these model conditions shows that SVDquartets returned the error message:
``No informative quartets were found in SVDQuartets analysis.''
Analysis of these datasets showed that each one had a very small number of parsimony-informative sites. The failing dataset with the most parsimony-informative sites had 13, and no dataset had more than one site exhibiting all four states.
See https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5946736 for some of these datasets.
